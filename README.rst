Briefcase iOS XCode Template
============================

A template for building Python apps that will run under iOS.

The easiest way to use this project is to not use it at all - at least,
not directly. `Briefcase <https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/>`__ is a
tool that uses this template, rolling it out using data extracted from
your ``setup.py``.

The master branch of this repository has no content; there is an
independent branch for each supported version of Python. The following
Python versions are supported:

* `Python 3.5 <https://github.com/beeware/briefcase-ios-xcode-template/tree/3.5>`__
* `Python 3.6 <https://github.com/beeware/briefcase-ios-xcode-template/tree/3.6>`__
* `Python 3.7 <https://github.com/beeware/briefcase-ios-xcode-template/tree/3.7>`__

Suggestions for template changes should be made against the `dev branch
<https://github.com/beeware/briefcase-ios-xcode-template/tree/dev>`__; these will
then be backported into the supported Python releases. The dev branch will
track the most recent supported version of Python (currently, Python 3.7)

See the individual branches for usage instructions.
